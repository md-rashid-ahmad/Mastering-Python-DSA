# 2 + 3 : 2 and 3 is operands, and " + " is Operators

In Python, operators are special symbols or keywords that are used to perform operations on variables and values. Python supports a variety of operators, which can be categorized into several types based on the operations they perform. Hereâ€™s an overview of operators.

      Arithmetic 
      Comparison
      Logical
      Assignment
      Bitwise
      Membership
      Identity

### Arithmetic Operators:

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.
      +     # Addition
      -     # Subtraction
      *     # Multiplication
      /     # Division (float division)
      //    # Floor Division (integer division)
      %     # Modulus (remainder)
      **    # Exponentiation

### Comparison (Relational) Operators:
Comparison operators are used to compare values. They return Boolean values (True or False).

            ==     # Equal to
            !=     # Not equal to
            >      # Greater than
            <      # Less than
            >=     # Greater than or equal to
            <=     # Less than or equal to

### Logical Operators:
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements. They return Boolean values.

      and   # Logical AND
      or    # Logical OR
      not   # Logical NOT (unary operator)


### Assignment Operators:
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
                  =    # Assign value
                  +=   # Add and assign
                  -=   # Subtract and assign
                  *=   # Multiply and assign
                  /=   # Divide and assign
                  //=  # Floor divide and assign
                  %=   # Modulus and assign
                  **=  # Exponentiate and assign


### Bitwise Operators:
Bitwise operators perform operations on binary representations of integers.

                  &    # Bitwise AND
                  |    # Bitwise OR
                  ^    # Bitwise XOR
                  ~    # Bitwise NOT (invert bits)
                  <<   # Left shift
                  >>   # Right Shift

### Membership Operators:
Membership operators test for membership in a sequence (e.g., strings, lists, tuples).

            in       # Evaluates to True if value is found in the sequence
            not in   # Evaluates to True if value is not found in the sequence


### Identity Operators:
Identity operators compare the memory locations of two objects.

                  is        # Evaluates to True if both variables point to the same object
                  is not    # Evaluates to True if both variables do not point to the same object
