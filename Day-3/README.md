# 2 + 3 : 2 and 3 is operands, and " + " is Operators

In Python, operators are special symbols or keywords that are used to perform operations on variables and values. Python supports a variety of operators, which can be categorized into several types based on the operations they perform. Hereâ€™s an overview of operators

1. Arithmetic 
2. Comparison
3. Logical
4. Assignment
5. Bitwise
6. Membership
7. Identity

1. Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.
+   # Addition
-   # Subtraction
*   # Multiplication
/   # Division (float division)
//  # Floor Division (integer division)
%   # Modulus (remainder)
**  # Exponentiation

2. Comparison (Relational) Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare values. They return Boolean values (True or False).

==   # Equal to
!=   # Not equal to
>    # Greater than
<    # Less than
>=   # Greater than or equal to
<=   # Less than or equal to

3. Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements. They return Boolean values.

and   # Logical AND
or    # Logical OR
not   # Logical NOT (unary operator)


4. Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
=    # Assign value
+=   # Add and assign
-=   # Subtract and assign
*=   # Multiply and assign
/=   # Divide and assign
//=  # Floor divide and assign
%=   # Modulus and assign
**=  # Exponentiate and assign


5. Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators perform operations on binary representations of integers.

&    # Bitwise AND
|    # Bitwise OR
^    # Bitwise XOR
~    # Bitwise NOT (invert bits)
<<   # Left shift
>>   # Right Shift

6. Membership Operators
Membership operators test for membership in a sequence (e.g., strings, lists, tuples).

in       # Evaluates to True if value is found in the sequence
not in   # Evaluates to True if value is not found in the sequence


7. Identity Operators
Identity operators compare the memory locations of two objects.

is        # Evaluates to True if both variables point to the same object
is not    # Evaluates to True if both variables do not point to the same object
