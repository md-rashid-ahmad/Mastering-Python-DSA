## Conditions in Python
Conditions in Python are used to make decisions in your code. They allow you to execute certain parts of your code based on     whether a condition is true or false. The most common way to use conditions is with if, elif, and else statements.

           Example:
            age = 18
            if age < 13:
                print("You are a child.")
            elif age < 20:
                print("You are a teenager.")
            else:
                print("You are an adult.")
